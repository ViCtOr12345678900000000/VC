                [Intro]<br/>
Ummm ummm, ohhh ohhhh
Ehnn ehnn, ohhh ohhh

[Verse 1]<br/>
Talking 'bout me man, big up your chest I swear
If you no get money e dey kill idea
Well I face my fears
There's nothing I can do from here
Omo, in the first stage I made mistakes I swear
For knowledge I sacrifice my fears
And I stand right here
I say I'm better and you can't compare<br/><br/>

[Chorus]<br/>
Cos when I give them gbedu e dey blow their mind
You know they can't see me outside
When me I dey work, I dey grind
When I give them gbedu e dey blow their mind
You know they can't see me outside
Cos me I dey work, I dey grind
When I give them gbedu e dey blow their mind
You know they can't see me outside
Cos me I dey work, I dey grind
When I give them gbedu e dey blow their mind
You know they can't see me outside
Cos me I dey work, I dey grind<br/><br/>


[Verse 2]<br/>
Me I still dey look for my cheddar
I know say nobody holy brudda
But if me and you get issues
I forgive you and I no reason you as the color for you
I know say nobody holy brudda and me I still dey look for my cheddar
But if me and you get issues
I forgive you and I no reason you and it's simply the truth
I tell you truth I no lie to you, jeje
And dem fit like dem fit dance it oh, jeje
And I go wild, I fit hide no more, for my cheddar
You know me I don't play
And dem no like dem like it oh, jeje
I no fit force untop on you oh, jeje
But you know say I gbadun you oh
You fit dance it oh, if e dey sweet you oh<br/><br/>

[Chorus]<br/>
Cos when I give them gbedu e dey blow their mind
You know they can't see me outside
When me I dey work, I dey grind
When I give them gbedu e dey blow their mind
You know they can't see me outside
Cos me I dey work, I dey grind
When I give them gbedu e dey blow their mind
You know they can't see me outside
Cos me I dey work, I dey grind
When I give them gbedu e dey blow their mind
You know they can't see me outside
Cos me I dey work, I dey grind<br/>
